# About French

French is a Romance language that evolved from Latin. It is an official language in many countries across Europe, Africa, North America, and international organizations. It is known for a rich literary tradition, clear phonetic patterns, and distinct grammar features such as noun gender and complex verb conjugation.

## Why learn French
- Widely spoken across multiple continents.
- Useful for travel, diplomacy, international business, and culture.
- Opens access to literature, film, and academic resources.

## What to expect
- Phonetics: nasal vowels, liaison, silent letters, and several accent marks (é, è, ê, ç).
- Grammar: gendered nouns (masculine/feminine), adjective agreement, and multiple past tenses.
- Verbs: many irregular verbs and important moods (indicative, subjunctive, conditional).
- Vocabulary: many cognates with English, plus some deceptive false friends.

## Practical learning tips
- Focus on high-frequency vocabulary and basic sentence structures first.
- Train listening and pronunciation early (shadowing, repetition).
- Practice speaking from the beginning; aim for simple conversations.
- Use spaced repetition for vocabulary; review grammar through examples.
- Read graded texts and watch short videos with transcripts or subtitles.

1. Pronunciation and basic greetings
2. Core vocabulary and present tense verbs
3. Past tenses (passé composé, imparfait)
4. Future, conditional, and pronouns
5. Subjunctive and advanced sentence structures
6. Immersion: media, conversations, and extended reading
