# About German (Deutsch)

German (Deutsch) is a West Germanic language native to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and parts of Italy and Belgium. It is one of the major world languages with rich literary, scientific and cultural traditions.

## Key facts
- Locale code: `de`
- Language family: Indo-European → Germanic → West Germanic
- Number of native speakers: ~90–100 million
- Writing system: Latin alphabet with three umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and the Eszett (ß)

## Characteristics
- Relatively free word order with strong verb-second (V2) tendencies in main clauses and verb-final in subordinate clauses
- Extensive inflection for nouns (case, number, gender) and verbs (person, number, tense, mood)
- Compound word formation is common and productive
- Formal vs. informal address: "Sie" (formal) vs. "du/ihr" (informal)

## Dialects and varieties
- Standard German (Hochdeutsch) used in media, education and formal writing
- Regional groups: High German (including Alemannic and Bavarian), Central German, Low German, and others
- Swiss German and Austrian German include vocabulary and pronunciation differences from Standard German

## Learning tips
- Focus early on noun genders and cases; learn nouns with their articles (der/die/das)
- Practice verb placement and separable verbs with sentence patterns
- Build vocabulary through compound words and context rather than individual roots

## Usage in a project
- Use locale identifiers like `de` or `de-DE` for German locales
- Provide formal and informal variants when addressing users (e.g., "Willkommen" vs. "Herzlich willkommen, Sie")
- Consider regional variants (de-AT, de-CH) for localized spelling and vocabulary
